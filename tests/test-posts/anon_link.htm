        Hey-yo,</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I have never built a PC and have been researching for a few days now about
            building an RTX 3070 or RTX 3080 build. This all stemmed when I purchased an MSI GL75 from Newegg during
            black Friday and felt that I could spend my 1,199 dollars on this RTX 2070 laptop, in an RTX 3070 (when
            stock finally comes around). I basically am trying to build an RTX 3070 in the 1,199 - 1,299 budget or an
            rtx 3080 build in the 1,299 - 1,399 budget.</p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><br></p>
        <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I currently came up with an RTX 3080 build at roughly 1,400. Any opinions on
            the parts I've chosen? Is there something I should spend a bit more to help "future proof" or have I
            sacrificed on something that wouldn't be worth it in the end?</p>
