<div class="usertext-body may-blank-within md-container "><div class="md"><p>I'm currently looking to do a total overhaul of my PC, moving to an AMD chipset.  The only thing I'm keeping is the case.  I'm debating keeping my current graphics card (RX 480) until I can get my hands on a 3060 ti (a man can dream), or upgrading to something else.  I've put together my build below.  I'm open to any and all suggestions.  Thanks!!</p>
