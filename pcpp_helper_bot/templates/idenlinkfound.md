I noticed you linked at least one identifiable PC Part Picker URL in your post, 
e.g. https://pcpartpicker.com/user/pcpp-helper-bot/saved/abc123. 
Next time you can just post an anonymous list URL, e.g. https://pcpartpicker.com/list/abc123 with an accompanying table.

These are your identifiable to anonymous list urls:
