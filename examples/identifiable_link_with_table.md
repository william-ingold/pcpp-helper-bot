Hello, I am the [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com) Helper Bot!

I noticed you linked at least one identifiable PC Part Picker URL in your post, 
e.g. https://pcpartpicker.com/user/pcpp-helper-bot/saved/abc123. 
Next time you can just post an anonymous list URL, e.g. https://pcpartpicker.com/list/abc123 with an accompanying table.

These are your identifiable to anonymous list urls:

* https://pcpartpicker.com/user/pcpp-helper-bot/saved/sH3ZJx &#8594; https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ZqWwj2


PC Part Picker will create the table for you if you click on the Reddit logo at the top of your list.
